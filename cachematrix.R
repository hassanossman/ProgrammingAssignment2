## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## Below are two functions that are used to create a special object that stores a numeric vector and cache's its mean.

## The first function, makeCacheMatrix creates a special "vector", which is a list containing a function to
# set the value of the vector
# get the value of the vector
# set the value of the inverse
# get the value of the inverse
# This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(solve) m <<- solve
  getinverse <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinverse = setinverse,
       getinverse = getinverse)
}


## 
# This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
# If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  
  m <- x$getinverse()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinverse(m)
  m
}
